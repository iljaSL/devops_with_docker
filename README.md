# devops_with_docker
My solutions for the introductory course to docker and docker-compose created by University of Helsinki and Eficode.

- [Part 1](https://github.com/iljaSL/devops_with_docker/tree/main/part1) introduces containerization with Docker and relevant concepts such as image and volume. 
- [Part2](https://github.com/iljaSL/devops_with_docker/tree/main/part2) introduces container orchestration with docker-compose and relevant concepts such as docker network.
- [Part3]() introduces production-ready practices such as container optimization and deployment pipelines.
